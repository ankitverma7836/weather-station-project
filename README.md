# weather-station-project
 weather station with Arduino that includes temperature and humidity sensing, barometric pressure sensing, soil moisture sensing, rainfall sensing, and displaying the data on a 32x4 LED display involves integrating multiple sensors and managing the display output effectively.
 Temperature and Humidity Sensor (DHT11/DHT22):
Follow the wiring mentioned in the previous example.
Barometric Pressure Sensor (BMP180/BMP280):
Follow the wiring mentioned in the previous example.
Soil Moisture Sensor (FC-28):
VCC to Arduino 5V
GND to Arduino GND
Analog output to any analog pin (e.g., A0)
Rainfall Sensor:
Refer to the datasheet for specific wiring details.
32x4 LED Display:
Connect SDA and SCL pins to Arduino's A4 (SDA) and A5 (SCL) respectively.
Connect VCC and GND to 5V and GND of Arduino respectively.
